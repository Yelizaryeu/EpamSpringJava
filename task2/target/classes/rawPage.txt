Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented  programming language that is designed to have
as few implementation dependencies   as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
to let  programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that  compiled Java    code can run on all
platforms that  support Java   without the need to  recompile. The syntax of Java  is similar to C and
C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
